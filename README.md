# odin-landing-page

In this project, I will be making a landing generic landing page.
It will have no REAL content, but instead placeholders for potential
content to be added at another time.

It will contain a header, a main title section, an information section (with
image placeholders), a quote section, a contact section, and a footer.

I will be making this using only flex-box to design the layout. Other CSS
rules of course, to make everything look <em>fancy</em>
